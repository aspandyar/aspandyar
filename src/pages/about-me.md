## My Academic Path 🎓

I started my academic journey at **([RSPM](https://astana.fizmat.kz/)) – Republican School of Physics and Mathematics** in Astana, Kazakhstan, enrolled on an academic grant. I graduated in **2022**, having immersed myself in **advanced mathematics and physics**, which shaped my analytical thinking and problem-solving skills.

After that, I joined **([AITU](https://astanait.edu.kz/en/main-page/)) – Astana IT University** for a **Bachelor in Computer Science**, also on a grant, from **Sept 2022 to Aug 2025**. Over these 3 years, I completed a **full academic course** with a **GPA of 3.5**, covering **web development, backend & frontend frameworks, cybersecurity, cloud foundations, math, and Linux**.

During my studies, I also enrolled in **Tech Orda: Sapsan School for Java Development** ([certificate link](https://google.com)), where I learned **Java, Spring Framework, and PostgreSQL**. My final project was a **social network**: [GitHub: Project](https://github.com/aspandyar/instagram).

From **Sept 2022 to May 2023**, I also studied at **ALEM School**, the **first Central Asian programming school based on peer learning**, emphasizing:
